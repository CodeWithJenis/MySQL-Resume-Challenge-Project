# 📊 Ad-Hoc Data Insights in Consumer Goods using MySQL & Power BI

This project is based on the **Codebasics Resume Challenge - Round 4**, where the goal was to **solve 10 real-world ad-hoc business requests** for an imaginary company called **AtliQ Hardwares**, a consumer goods manufacturer.

Although the original challenge deadline has passed, I completed the entire project **as part of my learning and portfolio-building journey**.
